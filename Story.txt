As he had many assignments due on the day, he decided to take a quicker path, a way through a forest which cuts right into the backdoor of his house.
The journey was simple and easy as Jon always played in this forest eversince he was a child, he knew the lands like they were his own home.
As Jon's house reached in his sight, suddenly he heard an eerie sound coming from the depths of the forest.
But with his house right in sight, Jon pounders, if he should investigate the mysterious sound or not.
