One day a boy named Jon was heading home after school. Unlike other days, he headed back at a later time today due to his fencing club practices.
As he had many assignments due on the day, he decided to take a quicker path, a way through a forest which cuts right into the backdoor of his house.
The journey was simple and easy as Jon always played in this forest eversince he was a child, he knew the lands like they were his own home.
As Jon's house reached in his sight, suddenly he heard an eerie sound coming from the depths of the forest.
But with his house right in sight, Jon pounders, if he should investigate the mysterious sound or not.

At first, Jon thought little of the noise, and proceeded back into his home to do his school work. However, he realized that he could not concentrate on
anything until he went and saw what had caused that strange sound. As he had watched many films that started like this, he decided to arm himself with a baseball
bat that was hanging on his well. One could never be to careful, he thought as he snatched it up. Heading out the back door of his house, he started to make his way 
towards the tree-line. He stopped right where he had heard the sound before, and stared into the depths of the woods, unsure of how to proceed. It was just then, 
that something amazing happened.
